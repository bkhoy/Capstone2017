## Project Description/Abstract
The SE Flow is a chlorine generator currently being developed by a team at MSR Global Health. In the future, the SE Flow will be deployed in countries to be used in clinics for infection prevention and control. We were given an opportunity to work with their team to design and develop an internal administrative dashboard that will help them manage and maintain their devices. In addition, we also developed a website for donors that have donated to this philanthropic cause that allows them to track their devices, hoping to give them a sense of fulfillment and encourage future donations.

## Repo Contents
The 'dashboard' directory contains all files and code related to the front facing dashboards as well as the backend web service. All web service and backend code will be contained in the "webservice" subdirectory. 

## Technology Stack Rationale
For the frontend dashboards, we used jQuery to make everything functional. We used open source software such as Chart.js to create the charts and DataTables for the table functionality. Finally, we used the Google Maps API to display the Google Maps on the donor dashboard. We chose these libaries because they were convenient and well documented, so that if there is future development work, the dashboard main be maintained easily.

For the backend, we had a LAMP stack running (Linux, Apache web server, MySQL RDBMS, PHP). We chose to use a LAMP stack to Isaac's experience and proficiency with each element in the LAMP stack.
