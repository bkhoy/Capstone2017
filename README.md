## Project Description/Abstract
The SE Flow is a chlorine generator currently being developed by a team at MSR Global Health. In the future, the SE Flow will be deployed in countries to be used in clinics for infection prevention and control. We were given an opportunity to work with their team to design and develop an internal administrative dashboard that will help them manage and maintain their devices. In addition, we also developed a website for donors that have donated to this philanthropic cause that allows them to track their devices, hoping to give them a sense of fulfillment and encourage future donations.

## Repo Contents
The 'dashboard' directory contains all files and code related to the front facing dashboards as well as the backend web service. All web service and backend code will be contained in the "webservice" subdirectory. 

## Technology Stack Rationale
For the frontend dashboards, we used jQuery to make everything functional. We used open source software such as Chart.js to create the charts and DataTables for the table functionality. Finally, we used the Google Maps API to display the Google Maps on the donor dashboard. We chose these libaries because they were convenient and well documented, so that if there is future development work, the dashboard can be maintained easily.

For the backend, we are using a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache web server, MySQL, PHP). We chose to use a LAMP stack because of Isaac's experience and proficiency with the LAMP stack. In addition, the LAMP stack is composed of all open source and free technologies. This was ideal for our project since the SE Flow is still in development and the dashboard was a proof of concept in many ways. So picking technologies that are free, well proven, and widely known were high prorities. Of course, the project is also for a global health project and so saving costs on the dashboard can hopefully translate into cheaper SE Flow devices.
