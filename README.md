# Project Description/Abstract
The SE Flow is a chlorine generator currently being developed by a team at MSR Global Health. In the future, the SE Flow will be deployed in countries to be used in clinics for infection prevention and control. We were given an opportunity to work with their team to design and develop an internal administrative dashboard that will help them manage and maintain their devices. In addition, we also developed a website for donors that have donated to this philanthropic cause that allows them to track their devices, hoping to give them a sense of fulfillment and encourage future donations.
